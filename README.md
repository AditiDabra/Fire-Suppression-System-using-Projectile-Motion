# Fire Suppression System using Projectile Motion
 This project is a fire suppression system that calculates and visualizes the projectile motion required to launch a nitrogen ball to extinguish a fire. Users enter the target fire location’s X and Y coordinates through a web interface. The system computes the optimal initial velocity, launch angle, and azimuthal angle, and displays a 3D trajectory plot showing the ball’s path from the launcher to the fire. In the future, the system will use image recognition to automatically detect fire locations and calculate the projectile’s path without manual input.
